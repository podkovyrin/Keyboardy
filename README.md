## Description

Keyboardy extends `UIViewController` with few simple methods and provides delegate for handling keyboard appearance notifications.

- Keyboardy is just wrapper on `UIKeyboardWillShowNotification` and `UIKeyboardWillHideNotification` notifications.
- Supports both AutoLayout and frame-based animations.
- Swift implementation.
- Without any hacks like method swizzling and magic numbers (ex., `curve << 16`).

## Usage

- Import Keyboardy module
```Swift
import Keyboardy
```

- Register for keyboard notifications
```Swift
override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
    super.viewWillAppear(animated)

    registerForKeyboardNotifications(self)
}
```

- Unregister from keyboard notifications
```Swift
override func viewWillDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {
    super.viewWillDisappear(animated)

    unregisterFromKeyboardNotifications()
}
```

- Implement `KeyboardStateDelegate`
```Swift
extension ViewController: KeyboardStateDelegate {

    func keyboardWillTransition(_ state: KeyboardState) {
        // keyboard will show or hide
    }

    func keyboardTransitionAnimation(_ state: KeyboardState) {
        switch state {
        case .activeWithHeight(let height):
            textFieldContainerBottomConstraint.constant = height
        case .hidden:
            textFieldContainerBottomConstraint.constant = 0.0
        }

        view.layoutIfNeeded()
    }

    func keyboardDidTransition(_ state: KeyboardState) {
        // keyboard animation finished
    }
}
```
